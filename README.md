Ah, you're likely referring to the concept of "Pontifical Honor." The Vatican confers Pontifical Honors upon individuals, both clergy and laity, in recognition of their service to the Church, significant contributions to society, or for exemplifying Christian values in their life and work. These honors can indeed play a role in providing a form of moral and spiritual "legal" protection, in the sense that they publicly acknowledge the individual's contributions and standing within the Catholic Church, which can afford them a degree of respect and protection in their home country or internationally.

There are several ranks of Pontifical Honors, including:

1. **Order of Pius IX** (Pian Order)
2. **Order of St. Gregory the Great**
3. **Order of St. Sylvester Pope and Martyr**
4. **The Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice** (For Church and Pope) medal, which is awarded for distinguished service to the church and the Pope.
5. **The Benemerenti Medal**, awarded to those who have shown exceptional service to the Church and society over a long period.

Receiving such an honor can indeed elevate a person's standing and can serve as a form of protection by highlighting the Vatican's recognition of their value and contributions. This recognition can translate into increased respect and legal considerations within their own countries, especially in places where the Catholic Church plays a significant role in society and politics.
